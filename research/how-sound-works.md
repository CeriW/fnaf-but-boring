# How sound works in Five Nights At Freddy's

The details contained within are taken from [this Youtube video by Scruffy](https://youtu.be/1yTIhtfgDwY) as well as my own experience playing the game

The audio in FNAF 1 can be split into three categories:

- Advantageous - audio that gives you clues and information
- Middle ground - audio that doesn't necessarily give you information, but does play as a direct result of something happening
- "Mud" - audio intended to muddy the water - at best is purely for ambience, and at worst meant to mislead, distract or scare you

## Advantageous audio

### Oven

[oven-1.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-1.mp3)  
[oven-2.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-2.mp3)  
[oven-3.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-3.mp3)  
[oven-4.mp3](../assets/sounds/oven-4.mp3)

A random one of these will play when Chica is in the kitchen, even when the camera is off (albeit quieter). This way you can tell Chica is in the kitchen without needing to find her on the cameras.

### Freddy

[freddy-move-1.mp3](../assets/sounds/freddy-move-1.mp3)  
[freddy-move-2.mp3](../assets/sounds/freddy-move-2.mp3)  
[freddy-move-3.mp3](../assets/sounds/freddy-move-3.mp3)

One of these sounds, chosen randomly each time, will play each time Freddy moves. Freddy is difficult to see on camera and always follows a set patch, so if you pay attention it can actually be easier to keep track of Freddy by counting how many times he's laughed rather than finding him on the cameras.

## Middle ground

- [camera-change.mp3](../assets/sounds/camera-change.mp3) plays if an animatronic on the screen you're looking at moves
- [foxy-run.mp3](../assets/sounds/foxy-run.mp3) plays when you are watching Foxy run down the hall at you
- [foxy-door-bash.mp3](../assets/sounds/foxy-door-bash.mp3) plays when Foxy is banging on your door after having run down the hall
- [doorway-warning.mp3](../assets/sounds/doorway-warning.mp3) plays when a light reveals an animatronic in your doorway
