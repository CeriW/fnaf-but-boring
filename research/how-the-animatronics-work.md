# How the animatronics work

All details on how the animatronics work are taken from this Youtube video by Tech Rules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujg0Y5IziiY

When using "left" and "right" in this document, this will be from the point of view of the player sat in the security office.

Freddy, Chica and Bonnie all move around during the night, generally getting closer to your office. Once they are at their final destination (outside the office for Bonnie and Chica, inside your office for Freddy), they will not jumpscare you right away, but rather they will wait for you to put up the cameras)


## Chica
Always shows up at the **right** door. You can prevent her from entering by closing the door. She will eventually go somewhere else.

## Bonnie
Always shows up at the **left** door. You can prevent him from entering by closing the door. He will eventually go somewhere else.

## Freddy
Always comes down the **left** corridor. Unlike Bonnie and Chica his progress will not reverse - he will always come towards you and never away from you.

Once he is in the space immediately outside your **left** door, he will wait until you have the cameras up. If your door is open at this time, you will be jumpscared once you put the cameras down.

Despite common belief, if you run out of power, not moving does not slow down the time you have before Freddy attacks you.

## Foxy
Moves from the stage in Pirate's Cove as a result of poor camera usage. Despite common belief, you don't actually have to look at the cameras specifically in Pirate's Cove - camera usage of any kind is enough to stop Foxy from moving.

If he is able to leave Pirate's Cove (TODO - HOW MANY STEPS BEFORE HE LEAVES?), he will rush down the **left** corridor at you.
* If the door is open at this time, he will jumpscare you.
* If the door is closed, he will bash on it, causing you to lose power before returning to Pirate's Cove. This power drainage is 1% the first time he does it, and increases by 6% each time after that.
